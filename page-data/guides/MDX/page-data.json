How is my data processed and protected?<br></br>\n   IBM takes clients data security and protection very seriously, for additional information please see Chapter 11 Security and Compliance\n\n\n2. What happens when the service encounters problems?<br></br>\n   Through the managed service monitoring software our IBM operations team is automatically alerted and will begin to take action and troubleshoot the service. In addition to this, on request IBM can work with Clients to setup an email distribution list for notifications of a reduced functionality or loss of service. These types of notifications would be distributed to Clients without undue delay upon confirmation of such an issue that is known or reasonably suspected by IBM to affect the Client. IBM will provide Client with reasonably requested information about such issue and the status of any IBM remediation and restoration activities.\n\n\n3. On which Cloud Service Provider is the service or application hosted? For example like AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.<br></br>\n   This offering is only available on IBM Cloud.\n\n\n4. How are the environments accessed via the network?<br></br>\n   By default, the servers are accessible through a Client site to site VPN on the server’s public IP addresses. These public IP addresses are utilized in order avoid conflicts with Clients internal IP private subnets.\n   Public IP’s are protected by the VPN and not accessible on the public internet.\n   DNS resolution will be provided by default, which will be sufficient for a majority of customers. Alternatively, Client may setup access through their own internal DNS service.\n\n\n5.

How do I open a support ticket?<br></br>\n   Once the welcome letter is received Clients are entitled to log support cases, the designated Cloud Service Coordinator (CSC) will walk Clients through the registration and setup process.
