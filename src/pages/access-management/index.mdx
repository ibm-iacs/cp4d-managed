By default, access to IBM® Cloud Pak for Data is managed via an internal repositoy database.<br></br>
A client is provided a user account with the administrative permissions for creating additional users.

Howerever, it is strongly recommended to use an Enterprise user repository instead of the internal CP4D repository database for managing user passwords and access.
Both SAML SSO and LDAP can be used for authentication together or individually.

## Setup access for users from an Enteprise User Directory
Setting up integration of a User Directory with Cloud Pak for Data involves a few steps:

- setup a dedicated private network channel between a ROSA cluster and an endpoint of the Enterprise User Directory (LDAP).
- configure a connection to the LDAP server from the Access control page in the CP4D Portal
- assign users to CP4D User Groups and Roles to tailor user access to platform resources
